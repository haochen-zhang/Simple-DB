1. Describe any design decisions you made, including anything that was difficult or unexpected.

add a override rollback() so it could take tid number and file offset so it could be used in recover().

recover() implements analysis, then redo and undo process.

just found wired situation that during test of TestAbortCommitInterleaved, one of the update tid is -1 from the log, cannot figure out what happened and it failed the tests.


2. Discuss and justify any changes you made outside of LogFile.java

All the changes are under the structure of Lab 6 distributed code.
